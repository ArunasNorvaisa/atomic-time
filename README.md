# Atomic time application
Gets atomic time based on user's location. Geolocation MUST be enabled in the browser in order for the application to work.

Made using React hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef).

It is my first experience with typescript, so please bear with me... Or, create a PR and make the code better. ;)

### Version
* 1.0.0

### Demo
* [https://arunas.org/time](https://arunas.org/time)

### Usage:
```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:ArunasNorvaisa/atomic-time.git
$ cd atomic-time
$ npm i -d (OR $ yarn)
$ npm start (OR $ yarn start)
```

Enjoy ;)
