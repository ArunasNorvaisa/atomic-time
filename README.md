# Atomic time application
Displays atomic time based on user's location.

Made with React hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef).

This is my first experience with typescript, so please bear with me... Or don't complain, create a PR and improve the code. ;)

### Version
* 1.0.1

### Demo
* [https://arunas.org/time](https://arunas.org/time)

### Usage:
```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:ArunasNorvaisa/atomic-time.git
$ cd atomic-time
$ npm i -d (OR $ yarn)
$ npm start (OR $ yarn start)
```

Enjoy ;)
