# Atomic time application
Gets atomic time based on user's location.

Made using React hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef).

It is my first experience with typescript, so please bear with me... Or, create a PR and make the code better. ;)

### Version
* 1.0.1

### Demo
* [https://arunas.org/time](https://arunas.org/time)

### Usage:
```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:ArunasNorvaisa/atomic-time.git
$ cd atomic-time
$ npm i -d (OR $ yarn)
$ npm start (OR $ yarn start)
```

Enjoy ;)
